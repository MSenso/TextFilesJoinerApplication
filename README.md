# TextFilesJoinerApplication

Application for joining directory txt files content in result file (sorting by file name).

To run this application, you should download TextFilesJoinerApplication.jar (in "out" directory), run cmd/terminal 
and run "java -jar path/to/TextFilesJoinerApplication.jar path/to/inputDirectory path/to/outputFile.txt"

Also, please, notice that having spaces in a path may lead to problems with running the application 
so you should move directory to another place and pass another path to output file.
